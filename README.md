# VSCode LSPs

Extracted from their upstream repositories and built individually.

- `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint`.

Credit to `hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted` for the original.

## Why another repo?

1. Doesn't get updated fast enough
2. Wanted the ability to choose which language servers to install
3. Wanted to be able to mix and match language server versions
